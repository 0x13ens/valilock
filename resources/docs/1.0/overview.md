## Development quickstart

Get up and running with our client libraries and start developing your Valilock integration.

Integrating Valilock into your app or website can begin as soon as you create a Valilock account, requiring only three steps:
1. Obtain your API keys so Valilock can authenticate your integration’s API requests
2. Install a client library so your integration can interact with the Valilock API
3. Make a test API request to confirm everything is up and running

## Step 1: Obtain your API keys
Valilock authenticates your API requests using your account’s API keys. If you do not include your key when making an API request, or use one that is incorrect or outdated, Valilock returns an error.
<br>
Every account is provided with two pairs of keys: one for testing and one for running live requests. All API requests exist in either test or live mode, and users, passwords, and so forth—in one mode cannot be manipulated by objects in the other.
<br>
Your API keys are available in the Dashboard. We include randomly generated API keys in our code examples if you are not logged in. Replace these with your own or log in to see code examples populated with your own test API keys.

## Step 2: Install a client library
We provide official libraries for different programming languages and mobile platforms.
